# xebuild2rgloader-patch
Converts XeBuild patches into RGLoader patches

This is/will be used for taking XeBuild patches, which are applied in-situ to bootloaders, and converting them into a format RGloader's loaderpatch uses. The idea is if one wanted or needed to externally patch a bootloader and use that resulting binary in something.
